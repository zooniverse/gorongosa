    s1:
      title: "Welcome!"
      content: "Welcome to Wildlife Watch! In this project, we are asking you to identify animals found in camera trap photos from around Wisconsin. Your help allows us better understand how animal populations across the state change through time."
    s2:
      title: "Identifying animals"
      content: "You are presented with a photo on the left and a list of potential animals on the right. When you spot an animal within a photo, simply click the corresponding animal on the right. You will be asked to supply some followup info, such as the number of animals found in the image."
    s3:
      title: "Filtering by characteristics"
      content: "Occasionally it is difficult to determine which animal is in the photo. Just above the list of animals is a variety of methods to filter the animal list. Selecting different options reduces the number of choices, making your job easier."
    s4:
      title: "Made a mistake?"
      content: "If you need to delete any of your existing marks while viewing an image, simply find your animal in the list below the image and click the 'X' icon. Don’t worry if you’re unsure about your choices, though—even a guess is more helpful than nothing!"
    s5:
      title: "That's it!"
      content: "You may catch up on project updates through speaking with other volunteers via Talk."

      <h2>Understanding wildlife populations</h2>
      <p>Forests are home to dozens of native mammals, hundreds of other vertebrate species, and thousands of invertebrates and native plant species, living together in diverse natural communities. WildlifeWatch is a collaborative effort to utilize camera traps, also known as trail cameras, to learn about the distribution and trends of our wildlife populations.</p>
    '''

    whyWeNeedYou: '''
      <h2>Why we need you</h2>
      <p>Over the course of a month, a single camera might take thousands of photographs. You help to make all these photographs meaningful by classifying the type and number of animals in the image. Because we know where and when these photographs were taken, we can create maps for both common and rare species across the state and visualize how animal populations change through time. From black bears to badgers, see what critters you can spot roaming the Wisconsin forests! Share your favorites and join the discussion about what you are observing along the way. We will share with you what we are learning back here at Zooniverse.</p>

      <h2>Citizen science in the classroom</h2>
      <p>Wildlife Watch is a great opportunity to integrate science and technology in the classroom and a unique way for students to learn about wildlife and their habitats.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.zooteach.org">ZooTeach</a> is a companion website to Zooniverse where educators can find and share educational resources relating to WildlifeWatch and the other Zooniverse citizen science projects. WildlifeWatch is a recent addition to Zooniverse, so if you have any ideas for how to use the project in the classroom, please share your lesson ideas or resources on ZooTeach.</p>

      <p>There are a number of excellent wildlife education resources available online. A few of our favorites are below:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/eek/">http://dnr.wi.gov/eek/</a> - Environmental Education for Kids! (EEK!) is an electronic magazine for kids in grades 4-8 published by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. It includes information on Wisconsin’s wildlife and resources for educators on how to help students use EEK!</li>
        <li><a href="http://projectwild.org/">http://projectwild.org/</a> - Project WILD is a nationwide program that provides resources for educators in teaching about wildlife and their habitat. The materials are available through Project WILD workshops lead by certified instructors. The Project WILD handbook includes more than 165 hands-on activities for PreK-12.</li>

      townsend: 'Phil Townsend is a professor of Forest &amp; Wildlife Ecology at the University of Wisconsin. He is interested in how different components of ecosystems interact across landscapes, for example how nutrients and water affect vegetation, and then how patterns of vegetation processes affect insects and animals. He is particularly interested in how we can leverage a range of technologies including remote sensing to better understand ecosystems.'
      zuckerberg: 'Dr. Benjamin Zuckerberg is an assistant professor in the Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. His research focuses on how climate change and habitat loss impacts wildlife populations. He is a strong advocate for the role of the public in collecting biological data. Using the data from these “citizen science” programs, Ben has studied shifts in bird ranges and migration in response to a changing climate.'
      deelen: 'Tim Van Deelen has been on the faculty at the UW-Madison since 2004. Tim’s research specializes in the applied management of wildlife with an emphasis on large mammals in Wisconsin and is a frequent collaborator with the Wisconsin DNR and the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Prior positions include working as the research specialist for deer in the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and as a Research Scientist for the Illinois Natural History Survey where he had a joint appointment with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.'
      singh: 'Aditya Singh is a post-doctoral scientist with the Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He uses a combination of airborne and remotely sensed data to study the impacts of environmental change and disturbance on landscape-scale indicators of ecosystem health.'
      martin: 'Karl Martin is the State Director for the Community, Natural Resource and Economic Development Program and an Assistant Dean with the University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension. He is an adjunct Associate Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Forest and Wildlife Ecology Department and recently served as the Wildlife and Forestry Research Section Chief at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Karl received his Bachelors degree in Wildlife Ecology at UW-Madison and his Masters and Doctorate degrees at Oregon State University. Karl’s research has focused on interaction of forest management and multi-scale wildlife habitat relationships. His current position focuses on the ‘Wisconsin Idea’ of taking the information and resources of the University to communities and citizens of the state.'

    organizations:
      uwm: 'Members of the Wildlife Watch team are ecologists at the University of Wisconsin Madison in the Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology. UW-Madison is a public, land-grant institution founded in 1848 whose mission is to provide “a learning environment in which faculty, staff and students can discover, examine critically, preserve and transmit the knowledge, wisdom and values that will help insure the survival of this and future generations and improve the quality of life for all.”'
      nasa: 'NASA provided partial funding for the first year of the project thought the Ecological Forecasting for Conservation and Natural Resource Management Program. The NASA Applied Sciences Program supports projects that enable uses of Earth observations in organizations’ policy, business, and management decisions.'
      wcbmn: 'The Wisconsin Citizen-based Monitoring (WCBM) Network provided funding for materials used in training citizen volunteers during the first year of the project. The WCBM Network is a stakeholder collaboration “to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of monitoring efforts by providing coordination, communications, technical, and financial resources and recognition to members of the Wisconsin citizen-based monitoring community.”'
      adler: 'The Adler Planetarium was founded in 1930 by Chicago business leader Max Adler. A recognized leader in public learning, the Adler inspires young people -particularly women and minorities - to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math. Scientists, historians and educators at the museum inspire the next generation of explorers.'
      uwExtension: 'The University of Wisconsin Extension provides ongoing support for the project. The Extension’s purpose is to "connect people with the University of Wisconsin and engage with them in transforming lives and communities."'
