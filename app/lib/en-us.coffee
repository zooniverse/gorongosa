    s1:
      title: "Welcome!"
      content: "Welcome to Snapshot Wisconsin! In this project, we are asking you to identify animals found in camera trap photos from around Wisconsin. Your help allows us better understand how animal populations across the state change through time."
    s2:
      title: "Identifying animals"
      content: "You are presented with a photo on the left and a list of potential animals on the right. When you spot an animal within a photo, simply click the corresponding animal on the right. You will be asked to supply some followup info, such as the number of animals found in the image."
    s3:
      title: "Filtering by characteristics"
      content: "Occasionally it is difficult to determine which animal is in the photo. Just above the list of animals is a variety of methods to filter the animal list. Selecting different options reduces the number of choices, making your job easier."
    s4:
      title: "Made a mistake?"
      content: "If you need to delete any of your existing marks while viewing an image, simply find your animal in the list below the image and click the 'X' icon. Don’t worry if you’re unsure about your choices, though—even a guess is more helpful than nothing!"
    s5:
      title: "That's it!"
      content: "That's it! You may catch up on project updates through speaking with other volunteers via Talk."

        Cities can be hostile places for wildlife, with threats coming from habitat destruction, roads and traffic, humans, pets and large numbers of invasive species.
        However, with proper management, urban areas can house a number of important wildlife species, including carnivores and small mammals.
        <br><br>
        To assess the biodiversity of the greater Chicagoland area, Lincoln Park Zoo’s Urban Wildlife Institute has established monitoring stations within city parks,
        forest preserves, golf courses and cemeteries across a four-county area, including downtown Chicago and its suburbs. Motion-triggered cameras are deployed four
        times per year at more than 100 sites to determine which species are present and to assess spatial and long-term patterns in wildlife communities.
        <br><br>
        Knowing where Chicago’s urban wildlife is located will help us to better conserve it. This knowledge will pave the way for future studies on the behavior and
        ecology of specific urban species, helping stakeholders to better manage wildlife conflict.
