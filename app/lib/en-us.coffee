    s1:
      title: "Welcome!"
      content: "Welcome to Wildlife Watch! In this project, we are asking you to identify animals found in camera trap photos from around Wisconsin. Your help allows us better understand how animal populations across the state change through time."
    s2:
      title: "Identifying animals"
      content: "You are presented with a photo on the left and a list of potential animals on the right. When you spot an animal within a photo, simply click the corresponding animal on the right. You will be asked to supply some followup info, such as the number of animals found in the image."
    s3:
      title: "Filtering by characteristics"
      content: "Occasionally it is difficult to determine which animal is in the photo. Just above the list of animals is a variety of methods to filter the animal list. Selecting different options reduces the number of choices, making your job easier."
    s4:
      title: "Made a mistake?"
      content: "If you need to delete any of your existing marks while viewing an image, simply find your animal in the list below the image and click the 'X' icon. Don’t worry if you’re unsure about your choices, though—even a guess is more helpful than nothing!"

      title: "That's it!"

      <h2>Understanding wildlife populations</h2>
      <p>Forests are home to dozens of native mammals, hundreds of other vertebrate species, and thousands of invertebrates and native plant species, living together in diverse natural communities. WildlifeWatch is a collaborative effort to utilize camera traps, also known as trail cameras, to learn about the distribution and trends of our wildlife populations.</p>
    '''

    whyWeNeedYou: '''
      <h2>Why we need you</h2>
      <p>Over the course of a month, a single camera might take thousands of photographs. You help to make all these photographs meaningful by classifying the type and number of animals in the image. Because we know where and when these photographs were taken, we can create maps for both common and rare species across the state and visualize how animal populations change through time. From black bears to badgers, see what critters you can spot roaming the Wisconsin forests! Share your favorites and join the discussion about what you are observing along the way. We will share with you what we are learning back here at Zooniverse.</p>

      <h2>Citizen science in the classroom</h2>
      <p>Wildlife Watch is a great opportunity to integrate science and technology in the classroom and a unique way for students to learn about wildlife and their habitats.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.zooteach.org">ZooTeach</a> is a companion website to Zooniverse where educators can find and share educational resources relating to WildlifeWatch and the other Zooniverse citizen science projects. WildlifeWatch is a recent addition to Zooniverse, so if you have any ideas for how to use the project in the classroom, please share your lesson ideas or resources on ZooTeach.</p>

      <p>There are a number of excellent wildlife education resources available online. A few of our favorites are below:</p>

He is interested in how different components of ecosystems interact across landscapes, for example how nutrients and water affect vegetation, and then how patterns of vegetation processes affect insects and animals. He is particularly interested in how we can leverage a range of technologies including remote sensing to better understand ecosystems.'
      zuckerberg: 'Dr. Benjamin Zuckerberg is an assistant professor in the Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. His research focuses on how climate change and habitat loss impacts wildlife populations. He is a strong advocate for the role of the public in collecting biological data. Using the data from these “citizen science” programs, Ben has studied shifts in bird ranges and migration in response to a changing climate.'
      deelen: 'Tim Van Deelen has been on the faculty at the UW-Madison since 2004. Tim’s research specializes in the applied management of wildlife with an emphasis on large mammals in Wisconsin and is a frequent collaborator with the Wisconsin DNR and the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Prior positions include working as the research specialist for deer in the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and as a Research Scientist for the Illinois Natural History Survey where he had a joint appointment with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.'
